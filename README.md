# knowledge-base - ##WIP
To store my knowledge as and when I learn something new

## why this project ?
Though I have learned/understood the things already, I tend to forget things that I don't use frequently.
So I google the things again and search for the blog/website that I had gone through.
What happens is my mind has the things but it is not able to index those data when i really required.
But when i see the same example/blog/website that helped me understood things my mind is able to index that data for me quickly.
To solve this i wanted to document things as and when i learn something new.
This is an experimental project for me to solve the problem that i'm facing.


## Note
If this helped you please star the project :)
